Add tcp settings to docker config  

If you want to use TCP/IP to connect to the Docker server, youâ€™ll need to make sure that your Docker server is listening on TCP port. To allow Docker server to use TCP add the following line to /etc/default/docker or /etc/:

	DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"

After restarting the Docker daemon you need to make sure that Docker is up and listening on TCP.

	$ docker -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 version
